# Estimating Stock Beta in SET using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks 

## Abstract
This project investigates the application of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, to estimate the **Systematic Risk (Beta)** of stocks in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)

While the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) traditionally estimates Beta using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, this assumes linearity and constant variance. This project proposes that an LSTM model can better capture the time-varying and non-linear nature of stock returns.
